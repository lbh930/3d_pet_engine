# PetEngine3D 
 
## Summary
Pet Engine 3D is a desktop render engine that enables visualization, modification, and interaction of 3D objects rendered on screen space.  
It would be something like Wallpaper Engine (on Steam) - but focusing on the 3D magic instead of animated 2D wallpapers. 
 
## Features in Progress
1. Customizable Shaders 
2. Customizable Mesh Models and Materials 
3. 3D animation support 
4. Animatable interactions beyond rotate & resize 
5. GUI user editor 
6. Content workshop platform (would be another server-side project)
